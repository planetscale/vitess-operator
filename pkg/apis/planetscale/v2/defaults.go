package v2

/*
All hard-coded default values for configurable aspects of objects in our API should go here.
However, hard-coded values that are not (yet) configurable in the API can live with the code.

These values are materialized into the object before processing begins.
This prevents defaults from being scattered throughout the processing code,
and in the future will allow us to associate defaults with specific API versions.

***COMPATIBILITY RULES***

* DO NOT change existing default values.
* DO NOT make these API-level default values configurable (e.g. by command-line flag).
* DO NOT add defaults that are only relevant to a specific user of the CRD.

New default values may only be added as new fields are added to the API Version (planetscale.com/v2),
and defaults for existing fields may only be changed along with the introduction of a new API Version
(e.g. `apiVersion: planetscale.com/v3`, but see below for a caveat). The defaults for that new API Version
will live in a different file in a different package (pkg/apis/planetscale/v3).

This rule, among other compatibility guarantees expected of all Kubernetes-style APIS, provides a contract
that makes it safe for users to upgrade without worrying about their configuration being changed silently
and in unpredictable ways.

CAVEAT: We CANNOT yet support adding a new API Version (e.g. planetscale.com/v3).

Currently, we only fill in these defaults in-memory, each time the controller processes an object.
Before we can add planetscale.com/v3, we'll need to do the following:

* Write a mutating admission webhook to materialize the v2 defaults into the actual data stored
  in the Kubernetes API server. This prevents the object's configuration from changing when the
  controller is updated to use v3.
* Write a CRD conversion webhook to translate objects back and forth between v2 and v3.
