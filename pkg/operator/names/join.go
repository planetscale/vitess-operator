/*
Join builds a name by concatenating a number of parts with '-' as the separator.

It will append a hash at the end that depends only on the parts supplied.
If the function is called again with the same parts, in the same order,
the hash will also be the same. This determinism allows you to use the resulting
name to ensure idempotency when creating objects.

However, the hash will differ if the parts are rearranged, or if substrings
within parts are moved to adjacent parts. The resulting generated name,
while deterministic, is thus guaranteed to be unique for a given list of parts,
even if the parts themselves are allowed to contain the separator.

For example: Join("a-b", "c") != Join("a", "b-c")
Although both will begin with "a-b-c-", the hash at the end will be different.

Note that after objects are created with these hashes in their names,
it's often unnecessary to compute the hash to subsequently look those objects up.
Instead, objects should be labeled with key-value pairs corresponding to the
parts that went into the name, allowing direct look-up by label selector.
Since labels are stored as key-value pairs, there is no danger of those values
causing confusion if they happen to contain the separator.
