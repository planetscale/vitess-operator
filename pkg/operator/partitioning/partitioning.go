EqualKeyRanges returns the list of KeyRanges for a partitioning into a given number of equal parts.

If the number of parts is a power of 2, the keyspace will be partitioned into
exactly equal parts.

Otherwise, the parts will only be approximately equal because the total number
of keyspace IDs is a power of 2, and nothing divides evenly into a power of 2
except other powers of 2. The approximate cut points are generally fine as
long as we choose them with a deterministic algorithm that spreads the
remainder as uniformly across shards as possible, as is done here.

WARNING: DO NOT change the behavior of this function, as it may result in the
         deletion of shards.

		Note that we use 2^64 as the numerator instead of 2^(8*numBytes),
		even though we throw away everything but the most-significant numBytes.
		The extra precision helps to spread the remainder uniformly across the
		shards when parts is not a power of 2.

		For example, if we had used 256 as the numerator, then the 10th of 10
		shards would own 24% more keyspace IDs than the rest. In a pathological
		case like n=129, using 256 as the numerator would have resulted in the
		last shard owning 50% of all keyspace IDs.
