Package lazy can be used to define placeholders for values that will be computed later.

Each struct in this package maintains a list of provider functions.
These providers are usually added to the list at package initialization
time in init() functions.

In this way, you can define at initialization time a set of sub-computations
that must be done to compute a combined value, even though the information
needed to actually carry out that computation is not yet available. When that
information (represented by the Spec interface) becomes available, you can pass
it to Get() to resolve the lazy value to a concrete value.

This allows complex structures like Pod or Container specs to be expressed in Go
code as simple struct literals, so they resemble the declarative form in which
Kubernetes APIs were designed to be viewed.

The use of init() functions means new providers can be added by adding new
files in a package, without the need to update a central list of which provider
functions to call for a given lazy value. This makes it easy to group providers
into separate functions and files based on the high-level feature they implement,
instead of forcing a grouping based on which computations they affect.

For example, you can add a feature that requires injecting various Volumes,
VolumeMounts, EnvVars, and Annotations by just adding one file that has all
the logic for that feature in one place, instead of having to go around and
update the Volume code, the VolumeMount code, the EnvVar code, and the
Annotation code in separate places.
