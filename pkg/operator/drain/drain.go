/*
Package drain defines a protocol for various agents (humans, controllers, scripts)
to cooperate to avoid disruption due to planned maintenance.

If a Pod or other object is annotated as requiring a drain step, any human or
automated agent that plans to delete it as part of a voluntary disruption
(e.g. config rollouts, app upgrades, Node upgrades, etc.) should first add an
annotation to the object requesting that it be drained. The agent should then
wait for another annotation to appear that confirms the object has been drained,
at which point the object can be safely deleted.

The exact behavior triggered by a drain request varies depending on the object.
The object's controller is responsible for doing whatever is appropriate to
minimize the disruption that would be caused by deleting the object in question.
For example, the VitessShard controller may need to do a planned reparent if the
object was a vttablet Pod that happened to be the master at the time.

By encapsulating this behavior into a drain request, we free all the various
sources of voluntary disruptions from needing to know how to prepare any given
object for deletion. Also, sending the request to the object's controller
instead of directly initiating actions like reparents makes it easier to reason
about how the system will respond under various conditions, since the controller
maintains sole authority over its objects.

StateTransitions computes state transitions for tablet drains in a given
shard.

The drainStates argument should be a map from your convenient and unique
object identifier (e.g. tablet alias) to the State of that object, which
you can find by calling drain.GetStates.

The return value returns a map populated with only the elements that should
change to a new State, and is keyed by the object identifiers you passed
in.

See below for why this function exists, and a proof of correctness.

# GOALS:

When human administrator wants to drain a node, we want them to have the
ability to safely drain tablets so that the drain can be done without
disrupting vitess clusters.

The workflow we are using now is:

- The administrator annotates tablets that should be drained as "draining".
- The operator annotates one and only one tablet as "finished".
	- Only if other health checks pass and the tablet is not a master.
- The administrator can safely delete the tablet annotated as "finished".

It is actually non trivial to ensure that one and only one tablet will be
marked as finished due to the fact that the operator might be behind in its
understanding of the state of the world, hence this state machine.

# ALGORITHM:

- If a tablet is "NotDraining", take no action.
- If a tablet is "Draining", mark as "DrainingAcknowledged".
- If any tablet is "Draining" but not "DrainingAcknowledged", do not mark any
tablet as "DrainingFinished".
- If all tablets were already either "NotDraining" or "DrainingAcknowledged"
before we made any modifications in this reconcile pass, mark the first
tablet (sorted by tablet alias) as "DrainingFinished".

# PROOF OF CORRECTNESS:

Assume you have two tablets, t1 and t2 that can be in states "not draining",
"draining", "draining-acknowledged", and "finished".

Assume t1 is first in the sort order, which means that if both are
"draining-acknowledged", t1 will always be the tablet set to "finished".

Assume we are marking t1 as "finished", but t2 is already marked as "finished":

- t1 is marked as "finished" only if t2!="finished" and t1="draining-acknowledged" is observed.
- This means t1 was set to "draining-acknowledged" before t2 was set to "finished".
- This means t2 was set to "finished" after t1="draining" was observed.

Step 3 is a contradiction, because t2 would never be set to "finished" at any point after t1="draining" was observed.

Assume we are marking t2 as "finished", but t1 is already marked as "finished":

- t2 is marked as "finished" only if t1!="draining, draining-acknowledged, or
finished" and t2="draining-acknowledged" is observed.
- This means that t1="draining" has not been observed.

Step 2 is a contradiction to the fact that t1 is already marked as "finished"
because t1="draining" has not yet been observed.
