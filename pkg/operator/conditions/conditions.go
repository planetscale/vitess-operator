/*
Package conditions has functions for working with status conditions in various Kubernetes APIs.

Status conditions are typically different Go types for every Kubernetes API,
so there's no way to do this generically without reflection.
Instead of reflection, we just hard-code a few helpers for the types we need.

There are sometimes upstream helpers for working with these types, but they're
usually not in a place that's meant to be shared with other projects.

	appsv1 "k8s.io/api/apps/v1"

// Deployment returns the given status condition from a Deployment.
// It returns nil if the condition is not populated in the object.
