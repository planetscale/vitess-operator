# Release Process

This doc describes the process to cut a new release of Vitess Operator.

## Prepare for Release

For each major release of the Operator, there is a release branch, for instance: `release-2.7`.
This branch must be created during the RC-1 release.

Before creating proceeding to the actual release, open PR to ensure the following are updated on `HEAD` of the release branch.

### Update GO Version

If Vitess's Go version has been updated since the last release update following files with the corresponding new version used at Vitess.

```console
build/Dockerfile.release
.github/workflows/**.yaml
go.mod
```

### Update Vitess Dependency

Each Vitess Operator minor version (`vX.Y.*`) is intended to correspond to a
particular Vitess major version (`vX.*.*`).
See the [compatibility table](https://github.com/planetscale/vitess-operator#compatibility)
for examples.

If you're cutting a new minor version, you should start by updating the version
of Vitess code that we build against:

```console
planetscale.dev/vitess-operator$ go get vitess.io/vitess@<git-commit-hash>
```

Note that the Go module version must be a git commit sha and not a tag like
`v9.0.0` because the Vitess repository doesn't follow all the `go mod` rules for
semantic versioning. You can look up the commit hash for a tag from the
[Vitess tags](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/tags) page.

For example, the `v9.0.0` tag corresponds to commit `daa60859822ff85ce18e2d10c61a27b7797ec6b8`
so this command would update Vitess Operator to build against Vitess v9.0.0:

```sh
go get vitess.io/vitess@daa60859822ff85ce18e2d10c61a27b7797ec6b8
```

### Update Compatibility Table

Add a new entry for the planned minor version to the [compatibility table](https://github.com/planetscale/vitess-operator/blob/main/README.md#compatibility)
in the README file.

The recommended Kubernetes versions depend on the version of the Kubernetes
client libs that Vitess Operator uses:

https://github.com/planetscale/vitess-operator/blob/111ac173e1c473853e66e270486ba8a9a47ecc54/go.mod#L35

The recommended server versions are those that match the minor version for the
client libraries, as well as server versions that are +/- one minor version
relative to the client libraries.

Note that we don't necessarily update to newer Kubernetes libraries at the same
time that we update to build against a newer Vitess release.
The Kubernetes library version is determined by the version of [Operator SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk)
that's in use.

## Cut Release

After the PR from the prepare phase is merged, make sure your local git dir is
up-to-date with HEAD, and then create a temporary release branch on top of the long-term release branch, for instance:

```
git checkout -b new-release-2.7.5 origin/release-2.7
```

And then, create the tag using the following command, note that you will need to replace the placeholder strings:

```
OLD_VITESS_VERSION="13.0.0" NEW_VITESS_VERSION="14.0.3" NEW_OPERATOR_VERSION="2.7.4" NEXT_OPERATOR_VERSION="2.7.5" ./tools/release/do_release.sh 
```

Here we want to release the version `2.7.4`. It will be tested against Vitess `v14.0.3`. The upgrade downgrade tests will begin with Vitess `v13.0.0`.

[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/planetscale/vitess-operator)
hould automatically detect the new tag and begin building a new image.

Create a [new release](https://github.com/planetscale/vitess-operator/releases/new)
in GitHub to describe the updates users should expect.

Follow the instructions prompted by the `do_release.sh` script. You will need to push the tag and push the temporary branch to finally create a Pull Request. The Pull Request should be merged onto the release branch.
