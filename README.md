## Compatibility

Vitess Operator depends on Vitess libraries and Kubernetes libraries that
each support a limited range of Vitess and Kubernetes versions, respectively.
These limitations mean each Vitess Operator version is only guaranteed to be
compatible with certain Vitess and Kubernetes versions, as shown in this table:

| Vitess Operator Version | Recommended Vitess Versions | Recommended Kubernetes Versions               |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `v2.11.*`               | `v18.0.*`                   | `v1.22.*`, `v1.23.*`, `v1.24.*`, or `v1.25.*` |
| `v2.12.*`               | `v19.0.*`                   | `v1.25.*`, `v1.26.*`, `v1.27.*`, or `v1.28.*` |
| `v2.13.*`               | `v20.0.*`                   | `v1.25.*`, `v1.26.*`, `v1.27.*`, or `v1.28.*` |
| `v2.14.*`               | `v21.0.*`                   | `v1.29.*`, `v1.30.*`, `v1.31.*`               |
| `v2.15.*`               | `v22.0.*`                   | `v1.30.*`, `v1.31.*`, `v1.32.*`               |
| `latest`                | `latest`                    | `v1.30.*`, `v1.31.*`, `v1.32.*`               |

If for some reason you must attempt to use versions outside the recommend
window, we still welcome bug reports since a workaround might be possible.
However, in some cases we may be unable to overcome the underlying limitations
in our dependencies.

Each major release of the vitess-operator will support the three latest major releases of Kubernetes at the time
of the vitess-operator's major release RC-1. This will ensure that the major release of the vitess-operator will
always support at least one major release of Kubernetes for its whole lifetime (1 year).
More information about the release cycle of vitess-operator in the following section.

### Release Cycle

For each major release of Vitess there will be a minor release of the vitess-operator.
Each minor release of the vitess-operator follows the same lifecycle as Vitess' releases:
1-year-long lifespan leading to an EOL the same day as the corresponding Vitess major release.

We might make new patch releases on an as- needed basis or when doing a patch release of Vitess.
Doing a patch release of Vitess does not necessarily mean that there will be a corresponding
patch release of the vitess-operator. The release lead will make a decision based on what has changed
in the operator since the last patch or major release.

### Supported Kubernetes Versions

Our goal for Kubernetes is for the latest Vitess Operator release to be
compatible with the latest Kubernetes version that's Generally Available on all
of GKE, EKS, and AKS. If we need to update our Kubernetes library dependencies
to keep the target Kubernetes version in our compatibility window, we'll update
HEAD of Vitess Operator and then cut a new minor release once we're confident in
the new pairing.

## Build
