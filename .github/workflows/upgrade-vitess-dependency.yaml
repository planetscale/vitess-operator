# This workflow creates a Pull Request that upgrades the Vitess Dependency of the vitess-operator.
# Because of the issue documented in https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/issues/48,
# a workflow cannot trigger the execution of other workflows when it creates a PR.
# The workaround we use to trigger the workflows on the new PR is to manually close and reopen the PR.
